Walruses are among the most recognizable animals of the Arctic, instantly identified by their massive size, thick, wrinkled hides, and the long ivory tusks that extend from their mouths. They belong to the pinniped family, which also includes seals and sea lions, but they stand out due to their unique adaptations. Adult males, known as bulls, can grow to be extremely large, while females are smaller but still impressively big. Their skin is thick and blubbery, providing insulation against the frigid waters of the Arctic Ocean, and their brownish-gray color often lightens when they spend extended periods on land, as their blood vessels expand to release heat. The tusks, which are elongated canine teeth, serve as multipurpose tools: walruses use them to break through ice, establish social rank, and even haul their massive bodies out of the water.

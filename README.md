# StegoCap - Hide Flags in Text with Capitalization
This project is a simple text steganography tool written in python  
It allows you to encode a hidden flag into a block of text by toggling capitalization  

The method is simple:
- **Uppercase letters** represent 1
- **Lowercase letters** represent 0

## Features
- Encode any string into a text file
- Decode the hidden string from the ciphertext
- Ignores spaces and punctuation during encoding/decoding

## Installation

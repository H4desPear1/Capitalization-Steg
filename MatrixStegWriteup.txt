The concept is pretty simple:
It works with a 5x5 matrix system to plot letters
[a, b, c,  d, e]
[f, g, h, i, j]
[k, l, m, n, o]
[p, q, r, s, t]
[u, v, w, x, y]

each letter is plotted on the image in the positions relative to the previous letter
so if you had the word "hi"
the coordinates that would flip would be (1, 2)(3, 6) (accounting for the 0 count on first col and row)
